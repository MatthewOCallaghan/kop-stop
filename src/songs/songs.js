		lyrics: 
			`Here's a song about a football team
			The greatest team you've ever seen
			A team that play total football
			They've won the league, Europe and all

			A Liverbird upon my chest
			We are the men of Shankly's best
			A team that plays the Liverpool way
			And wins the Championship in May

			With Kenny Dalglish on the ball
			He was the greatest of them all
			And Ian Rush: four goals or two
			Left Evertonians feeling blue

			Now if you go down Goodison Way
			Hard luck stories you hear each day
			There's not a trophy to be seen
			'Cos Liverpool have swept them clean

			A Liverbird upon my chest
			We are the men of Shankly's best
			A team that plays the Liverpool way
			And wins the Championship in May

			Now on the glorious 10th of May
			There's laughing reds on Wembley Way
			We're full of smiles and joy and glee
			It's Everton 1 and Liverpool 3

			A Liverbird upon my chest
			We are the men of Shankly's best
			A team that plays the Liverpool way
			And wins the Championship in May

			Now on the 20th of May
			We're laughing still on Wembley Way
			Those Evertonians feeling blue
			at Liverpool 3 and Everton 2

			A Liverbird upon my chest
			We are the men of Shankly's best
			A team that plays the Liverpool way
			And wins the Championship in May

			And as we sang round Goodison Park
			With crying blues all in a nark
			They're probably crying still
			at Liverpool 5 and Everton 0

			A Liverbird upon my chest
			We are the men of Shankly's best
			A team that plays the Liverpool way
			And wins the Championship in May

			We remember them with pride
			Those mighty reds of Shankly's side
			And Kenny's boys of '88
			There's never been a side so great

			A Liverbird upon my chest
			We are the men of Shankly's best
			A team that plays the Liverpool way
			And wins the Championship in May

			Now back in 1965
			When great Bill Shankly was alive
			We're playing Leeds: the score's 1-1
			When it fell to the head of Ian St John

			A Liverbird upon my chest
			We are the men of Shankly's best
			A team that plays the Liverpool way
			And wins the Championship in May

			On April 15th '89
			What should have been a joyous time
			Ninety-six friends, we all shall miss
			And all the Kopites want justice (JUSTICE!)

			A Liverbird upon my chest
			We are the men of Shankly's best
			A team that plays the Liverpool way
			And wins the Championship in May`,
